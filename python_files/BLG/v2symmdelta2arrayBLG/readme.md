I'm using for the right hopping matrix not Ty.conj().T, but rather just Ty.T to see if this might be right, and running through slurmEmulator with 1 task, i.e taskid 0

My expectation: The LDOS should be the same what it was before with the VHS at exactly the right spot, if it's not, then there's something wrong I suppose
